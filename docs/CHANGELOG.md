### Additions and New Features

- Added "Common misconceptions" section at the top of `docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md` highlighting frequently violated rules for AI agents.
- Added "DO NOT HIDE BUGS WITH DEFAULTS" section to `docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md` covering `dict.get()` misuse, `value or fallback` patterns, and silent exception swallowing.
- Added "IMPORT REQUIREMENTS" section to `docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md` documenting that all imports must come from stdlib, repo-local modules, or declared pip dependencies.
- Added explicit ban on relative imports (`from . import`) to the IMPORTING section of `docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md`.

### Behavior or Interface Changes

- Clarified shebang rules in `docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md` to explicitly state shebangs belong only on runnable scripts with main guards, not on library modules, test files, or helpers.

## 2026-03-13

### Additions and New Features

- Added `docs/CLAUDE_HOOK_USAGE_GUIDE.md` to `STYLE_FILES` in `propagate_style_guides.py` so it is copied to target repos.
- Added `@docs/CLAUDE_HOOK_USAGE_GUIDE.md` reference to template `CLAUDE.md`.

### Behavior or Interface Changes

- Changed `propagate_style_guides.py` to merge `CLAUDE.md` instead of overwriting, preserving repo-specific `@` reference lines in target repos.

### Fixes and Maintenance

- Fixed `devel/commit_changelog.py` to detect staged (`git add`) changelog changes by falling back to `git diff --cached` when the unstaged diff is empty.

## 2026-02-22

- Updated `docs/REPO_STYLE.md` to require consistent section headings for each changelog day block (`Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Failures`, `Decisions`) and to keep empty sections with `- None.`.
- Updated `docs/REPO_STYLE.md` section names for changelog day blocks to `Additions`, `Updates`, `Removals`, `Failures`, and `Validations`.
- Updated `docs/REPO_STYLE.md` changelog day template to also require `Fixes` and `Decisions` sections.
- Updated `docs/REPO_STYLE.md` changelog policy language: empty categories are optional, every entry must be categorized, entries are never removed (only rephrased), and day category names are now the six longer labels.

## 2026-02-20

- Added `tests/test_init_files.py` to enforce surface-level `__init__.py` style rules from `docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md`, including checks for non-docstring implementation, imports, exports/maps, global assignments, and `__version__` assignments.
- Scoped `tests/test_init_files.py` to analyze only substantial `__init__.py` files and write violations to `report_init.txt` with stale report cleanup at test startup.
- Updated `propagate_style_guides.py` and `.gitignore` to include `test_init_files.py`.
- Simplified gitignore management to require `report_*.txt` and clean up legacy per-report entries in `propagate_style_guides.py`.
- Updated `tests/test_init_files.py` so the no-`__init__.py` case reports pass instead of skip.
- Updated `propagate_style_guides.py` to skip propagating `source_me.sh` into repositories that are already present on `PATH` (for example `junk-drawer`).
- Optimized `tests/test_pyflakes_code_lint.py` to run `pyflakes` once per pytest session and reuse indexed results for per-file tests, preserving one-dot-per-file output while reducing runtime overhead.
- Updated `docs/REPO_STYLE.md` to clarify that changelog entries should capture notable failures and key implementation choices, not only successful changes.

## 2026-02-19

- Added `tests/test_import_dot.py` to fail on relative from-import statements such as `from . import x` and `from .module import x`.
- Updated `propagate_style_guides.py` so `test_import_dot.py` is included in propagated test scripts.
- Updated `tests/test_import_star.py` and `tests/test_import_dot.py` to write per-test report files (`report_import_star.txt` and `report_import_dot.txt`), remove stale reports at test start, and include report paths in assertion failures.
- Renamed `tests/test_import_requirements.py` output to `report_import_requirements.txt` (from `report_imports.txt`) while preserving existing report generation and stale-file cleanup behavior.
- Added import report files to `.gitignore` and `propagate_style_guides.py` required ignore entries: `report_import_star.txt`, `report_import_dot.txt`, and `report_import_requirements.txt`.
- Restored per-file parametrized execution in `tests/test_import_star.py` and `tests/test_import_dot.py` so pytest shows one dot/failure per scanned file while still writing per-test report files.

## 2026-02-16

- Fixed false positives in `tests/test_shebangs.py` where Rust inner attributes (`#![...]`) were misidentified as shebangs, causing `.rs` files to be flagged under `shebang_not_executable`.

## 2026-02-14

- Trimmed `propagate_style_guides.py` to stop editing existing `AGENTS.md` files in target repositories while keeping a no-overwrite bootstrap copy when `AGENTS.md` is missing.
- Added a no-overwrite style file category in `propagate_style_guides.py` so `AGENTS.md` and `docs/AUTHORS.md` are copied only when absent and never updated in-place.
- Updated `propagate_style_guides.py` style destination routing so `CLAUDE.md` is propagated with overwrite to repo root while standard style guides continue to copy into `docs/`.
- Refactored `propagate_style_guides.py` file lists to explicit `(source_name, target_path)` mappings for overwrite and no-overwrite categories, removing special-case destination branching.
- Simplified `propagate_style_guides.py` file lists again to target-relative paths only, deriving source filenames from basename while preserving overwrite/no-overwrite behavior.
- Updated `propagate_style_guides.py` default source lookup/help text to use `<base>/starter_repo_template` instead of `<base>/junk-drawer`.
- Clarified in `README.md` that only `README.md` and `docs/CHANGELOG.md` are repo-specific, while other files are intended to remain generic template infrastructure.
- Standardized `README.md` with a concise infrastructure-focused overview, curated `docs/` links, and a verifiable quick-start test command.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to direct AI agents to run commands with `bash -lc` (not Zsh) so `source_me.sh` works with expected shell semantics.
